3. WhyICode.tsx
A small section on your “why” — keep it human

Example: “I fell in love with building systems that help people…”

You can quote your own philosophy or thinking here.

4. TechNerd.tsx
Dedicated to your deep interests:

Open Source: Contributions, favorite tools/repos

Neovim: Dotfiles, setup, community stuff

Could use icons or logos




@theme {
  --color-dark: #222831;
  --color-steel: #30475e;
  --color-accent: #f05454;
  --color-light: #dddddd;
  --color-text: #cfd2dc;
}


which can be used like color-dark color-steel etc in tailwind classes

i want to combine these two sections and create a page.

      <section className="h-screen w-full snap-start">

        <ComesHere />

      </section>
