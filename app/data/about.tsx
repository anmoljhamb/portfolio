  <>
    I am a developer driven by a passion for turning complex challenges into
    elegant, end-to-end solutions. My journey started with a teenage dream of
    building my own AI and has evolved into a career focused on crafting
    impactful software. I thrive on the entire creation process, from a
    back-of-the-napkin idea to a polished, shipped product.
